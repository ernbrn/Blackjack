Foreward:
* You start out with $100. You will be able to make money, but a warning: once
your money is all gone, your game is over.

*You are playing against the dealer. Rob him blind.

*In the event you and the dealer tie, you will not lose the money you bet. This
is called a push

*In the event you win (good luck with that), your bets will be doubled.

Rules:
1) Place your bet. There is no minimum, and your maximum is only however much
mooh-lah is in your bank.

2) Place a 2nd bet after you see your hand.

3) Choose to hit or not

4) Choose to show or not. You decide when the game ends.

5) Have fun, try not to stay up all night playing.
